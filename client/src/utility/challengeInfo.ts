  description: "Our coding challenge platform offers users the chance to challenge each other across three distinct difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level comes with its own set of problem types and judging criteria, ensuring a fair competition based on skill and complexity. The question will be assigned from our end randomly based on the level and language that users selected.",

      levelName: "Friendly Spar",
      description: "At the Easy level, problems are basic and focus on foundational tasks like reversing arrays or checking if a number is prime or even. Judging is based on code submission time, efficiency, and line of code."

    {
      levelName: "Tactical Duel",
      description: "The Medium level introduces algorithmic problems such as Two-Sum, string compression, or binary search. Here, the focus is on both correctness and code efficiency, with faster and cleaner solutions ranking higher."

      levelName: "Ultimate Showdown",
      description: "For the Hard level, advanced problems like N-Queens or finding the Kth largest element test participants on time and space complexity. Judging emphasizes optimal performance and clean code, rewarding those who solve problems efficiently at scale."
